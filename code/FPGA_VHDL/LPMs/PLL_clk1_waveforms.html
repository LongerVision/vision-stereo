<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file PLL_clk1.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altpll megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design PLL_clk1.vhd. The design PLL_clk1.vhd has Cyclone AUTO pll configured in NORMAL mode The primary clock input to the PLL is INCLK0, with clock period 20833 ps. CLK0 multiply by = 1, CLK0 divide by = 2, CLK0 phase_shift = 0 CLK1 multiply by = 3, CLK1 divide by = 8, CLK1 phase_shift = 0 Input port ARESET is used. This port is active high. When asserted, it will cause the LOCKED port and all CLK outputs to drop to zero. The PLL will relock to the input clock when this port is deasserted. </P>
